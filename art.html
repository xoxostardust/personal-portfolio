            <h2>Machine "Learning"</h2>
            <p>“Machine ‘Learning’” is a piece of artwork I created for the Coding School’s “Introduction to Artificial
                Intelligence and Machine Learning” course. The only program I used was Procreate. Additionally, the
                purpose of this sample was to illustrate our understanding of machine learning concepts and other
                lessons taught in the class. I decided to create this based on my knowledge of computer vision, data
                augmentation, and AI ethics. Because AI image generation heavily relies on the first two processes, I
                included computer vision by making the background consist of a visual dataset for the AI to train for
                object classification. To add on, I applied data augmentation by the final AI art piece consisting of
                similar-looking generations of its data set. Finally, I represented the ethics of AI "stealing" art by
                drawing artists within the final piece holding up their original drawings. This was supposed to
                represent the issue with AI heavily referencing datasets too much which results in a lack of credit and
                copyright. Ultimately, I wanted to showcase this work because I felt that it showed my understanding of
                machine learning, as well as skill in digital art.

            <h2>Jolyne Fan Art</h2>
            <p>This is a fan-art drawing of Jolyne from “Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure”, a popular Japanese anime. Similar to
                my first sample, I only used Procreate for its production. I drew it when I was facing an art block in
                an attempt to regain my creative spark. I was not a fan of the show then, however, I liked Jolyne’s
                character design and bright color palette. I was used to drawing with neutral colors, so I wanted to
                experiment with the bright shades her character consisted of. I chose this piece for my portfolio
                because I want to highlight my own personal work, as well as professional. Although this is not a
                professional/career-worthy piece, I still find it important to find intrinsic motivation for things you
                love rather than pure extrinsic motivation. While my artistic abilities definitely aid me in original
                website illustrations, they also allow me to experiment with my creativity and express myself in a
                visual way.
